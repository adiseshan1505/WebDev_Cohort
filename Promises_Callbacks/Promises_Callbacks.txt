So this is a very important concept.
To use inbuilt promises is easy but hard to create them on your own.

Some basic callbacks:- 
setTimeout and setInterval

- setTimeout basically executes a snippet or a piece of code after certain time in ms.
- setInterval whereas repeats the same thing for certain time interval in ms.

callbackFunction
- so basically a function is higher ordered and is called again and creates a wrapper for setTimeout
- refer (callbackFuncs.js)
