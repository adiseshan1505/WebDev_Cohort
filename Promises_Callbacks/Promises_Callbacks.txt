So this is a very important concept.
To use inbuilt promises is easy but hard to create them on your own.

Some basic callbacks:- 
setTimeout and setInterval

- setTimeout basically executes a snippet or a piece of code after certain time in ms.
- setInterval whereas repeats the same thing for certain time interval in ms.

callbackFunction
- so basically a function is higher ordered and is called again and creates a wrapper for setTimeout
- refer (callbackFuncs.js)

Promises:-
So promise is a class gives you a promise that I will return you something in the future.
in promises, especially the ones that u create, you create a func that returns a promise, then u create a 
callback func, so you actually call the func that returns a promise then the callback
like:- func().then(callback)

Promises are syntactically a superior way of writing callbacks
