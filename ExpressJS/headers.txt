Mainly whenever u go to any website u r sending HTTP requests to that specific website's server.
On a single machine(MacOS/ Windows) u can run many HTTP servers on diff ports.
You can have multiple processes running at the same time.
A single machine can run many multiple servers, one handline load on one port and so on...

Note:- on one port more than one process can never take place.

Headers:- 
there are headers sent to an HTTP server.
say:- updating a tweet, so u send a put request na to api.twitter.com/tweet where in the body u have the description
and all.
So headers are extra meta-data that u send
So when u send an HTTP request u also send a request header, that does the following:-
They tell server how to interpret the body, provide authentication info, managing caching, cookies
,lang preferences, content-type (JSON ya XML)
define content format and more...
Body is ur actual content, like updated description, media of the tweet.
Response header is the o/p of ur request that is reflected in the body.
