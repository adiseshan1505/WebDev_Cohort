This asyncJS directory, also has oops
In Synchronous JS we have like code that gets executed line by line in the order at which it is written.
But in Asynchronous we have tasks or code that can be executed based on choice.

classic example:- Boil water, laundry, buy paneer from shop.
In Synchronous point of view:-
    - First boil water, once done completely exit that task.
    - Next do laundry like ironing and all. Once done exit that as well.
    - Then last buy paneer from shop, once done u come back home.
U see above right all tasks u do one by one in that order and it takes a lot of time. like an hour.

In Asynchronous point of view:-
    - You start boiling water and let it boil.
    - You move onto next task and do ironing and keep track of the water to boil. If done before ironing switch gas
      off. Else, when done after ironing then switch gas off. So 2 tasks done concurrently.
    - Then you buy paneer.
Takes lesser time right and more efficient.
